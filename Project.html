    <h2><u>Real-Time Attendence Access Control Using Face Recognition</u></h2>
    <p>
                             This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in, and time-out of employees. It covers areas such as facial detection, alignment, and recognition, along with the development of a web application to various use cases of the system.
       The various use case include registration of new employees, addition of photos to the training dataset, viewing attendance reports, etc. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential. 
       The purpose of this document is to specify software requirements of the Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition. 
       It is intended to be a complete specification of what functionality the Attendance Management System provides. 
       Furthermore, this project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. 
       It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, out time, break time and attendance digitally. 
       Digitalization of the system would also help in better visualization of the data using graphs to display the no. of employees present today, total work hours of each employee and their break time. 
       Its added features serve as an efficient upgrade and replacement over the traditional attendance system
